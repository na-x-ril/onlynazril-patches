/**
 * The copy-comment patch's hooks: what the clipboard receives when a comment is copied.
 *
 * TikTok puts the commenter's name in front of the text before it copies. Two routes do it, and
 * both are answered here:
 *
 *  - the comment sheet's own Copy builds its {@code ClipData} through one static builder that takes
 *    the name prefix, the text and the text's emoji spans apart. The patch blanks the prefix at the
 *    top of that builder; the text and its emoji are left exactly as the app built them. This is
 *    the route every comment copy from the sheet takes on 47.0.3 and 47.1.4.
 *  - another menu (Favorites → Comments, and the reply copy) joins the name and the text itself and
 *    hands the one string to a plain-text clipboard helper. There the patch replaces that string
 *    with the comment's own text at the call, so the joined name never reaches the clipboard.
 *
 * Both ask the same switch, and each reports its own branch: a copy that keeps the username and a
 * hook that never ran look the same on screen.
