/**
 * Anchors for the custom-font patch.
 *
 * The class that owns the anchors is obfuscated and renames with every
 * build: on 46.5.3 it is `X.05oe`, on 47.0.3 `X.0lNd`, on 47.1.4
 * `X.05o5`. What does not move, on every version checked, is the shape:
 *
 *  - the class reads one of the font files TikTok bundles as its own
 *    faces, `font/TikTok-Display-Regular.otf` or
 *    `font/TikTok-Text-Regular.otf`, in the factory method itself;
 *  - the factory is static and takes the nine parameters below,
 *    returning the face to draw with. TikTok resolves a variable-font
 *    request (weight, width, slant, optical size axes) through it and
 *    falls back to the bundled static faces when the platform builder
 *    has none.
 *
 * Every other Typeface factory in the bundle takes fewer parameters,
 * so the nine-parameter shape is unique without a name.
